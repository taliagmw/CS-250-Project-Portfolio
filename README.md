Creating user stories helps to interpret user needs by breaking down what users are asking of the Scrum team while also assigning importance to them. This allows for developers to see if more than one user asked for a specific thing to be added or if there is just something to be changed in the layout. I hope to include most of the Agile planning processes in future work because they helped to adjust for any interruptions while still keeping me on track. To be a good team member in software development, you must connect with your team and keep up good communication without insulting each other or taking on more work than you can handle. Everyone has a part to play and no part is better than another.
